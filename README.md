<h3>Hello, this is git repository for my portfolio page.</h3>
<div>here are some things I think are important to know:</div>
<ul>
<li>I used HTML, SCSS and ReactJS to create this page.</li>
<li>I used Redux-toolkit for state management, as simple useState hook isn't enough to manage the global state.</li>
<li>I have also used React router for my website. </li>
</ul>
